## Introduction

This artifact is a newsletter-style analysis examining how artificial intelligence is already being used commercially across multiple industries. Rather than focusing on experimental research or model performance alone, this work highlights how AI has moved into real operational workflows and is actively shaping business decisions today.

This artifact reflects my growth in thinking critically about AI not just as a technical tool, but as a driver of organizational change, strategy, and leadership.

## Description

The newsletter analyzes recent commercial AI releases and deployments across three industries: manufacturing, automotive, and enterprise operations. Each section explains what was introduced, how it is being used in practice, and why it matters from a business perspective.

A comparative visualization is included to show how AI delivers value differently across industries, reinforcing that AI adoption must align with specific operational needs rather than follow a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Process

To create this newsletter, I followed these steps:

1. Researched recent AI product releases and announcements from reputable industry sources.
2. Selected three industries where AI adoption shows clear, measurable business impact.
3. Evaluated each use case using comparative dimensions such as speed, quality, and governance.
4. Synthesized findings into a structured, accessible newsletter format.
5. Developed a comparative chart to visually support cross-industry analysis.
